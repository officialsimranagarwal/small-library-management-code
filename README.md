## 📖 Overview

A robust **C++ Console Application** for managing a small library. It provides an Administrator interface to manage books and students, and a User interface for issuing and returning books. Data is persisted using binary file handling.

## ✨ Features

-   **Admin Control**: Create, modify, display, and delete records for Books and Students.
-   **Circulation**: Issue books to students and track returns.
-   **Fine Calculation**: Automatically calculates fines for late returns (Rs. 1 per day after 15 days).
-   **Search**: Search for specific books or students by ID.

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Compile**:
    ```bash
    g++ code.cpp -o library_system
    ```
2.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    ./library_system
    ```
3.  **Navigate**: Use the implementation-specific menu keys (1-4) to access Administrator or Transaction menus.
